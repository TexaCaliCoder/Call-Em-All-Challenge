# Thoughts leading to development

Originally I was going to use material UI or some other form of component library for this. Instead this being a smaller
app I figured I would build my own. I feel that it will give me the chance to accomplish a few of the required tasks 
efficiently by using functional components to be passed to the class components and to pass props back down.
